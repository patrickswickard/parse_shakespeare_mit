<a name="1.1.1">If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on</a><br>
<a name="1.1.2">the like occasion whereon my services are now on</a><br>
<a name="1.1.3">foot, you shall see, as I have said, great</a><br>
<a name="1.1.4">difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.</a><br>

<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.5">I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia</a><br>

<a name="1.1.7">Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be</a><br>

<a name="1.1.9">Beseech you,--</a><br>

<a name="speech5"><b>ARCHIDAMUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.10">Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:</a><br>
<a name="1.1.11">we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know</a><br>
<a name="1.1.12">not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.13">that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.14">may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse</a><br>

<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.19">Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.</a><br>
<a name="1.1.20">They were trained together in their childhoods; and</a><br>
<a name="1.1.21">there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.22">which cannot choose but branch now. Since their</a><br>
<a name="1.1.23">more mature dignities and royal necessities made</a><br>
<a name="1.1.24">separation of their society, their encounters,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.25">though not personal, have been royally attorneyed</a><br>
<a name="1.1.26">with interchange of gifts, letters, loving</a><br>
<a name="1.1.27">embassies; that they have seemed to be together,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.28">though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and</a><br>
<a name="1.1.29">embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed</a><br>
<a name="1.1.30">winds. The heavens continue their loves!</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech9"><b>ARCHIDAMUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.31">I think there is not in the world either malice or</a><br>
<a name="1.1.32">matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable</a><br>
<a name="1.1.33">comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a</a><br>
<a name="1.1.34">gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came</a><br>
<a name="1.1.35">into my note.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech10"><b>CAMILLO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.36">I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it</a><br>
<a name="1.1.37">is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the</a><br>
<a name="1.1.38">subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on</a><br>
<a name="1.1.39">crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to</a><br>
<a name="1.1.40">see him a man.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech11"><b>ARCHIDAMUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.41">Would they else be content to die?</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech12"><b>CAMILLO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.42">Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should</a><br>
<a name="1.1.43">desire to live.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech13"><b>ARCHIDAMUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.44">If the king had no son, they would desire to live</a><br>
<a name="1.1.45">on crutches till he had one.</a><br>
