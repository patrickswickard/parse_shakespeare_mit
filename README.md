# parse_shakespeare_mit

This includes moderately cleaned up files from http://shakespeare.mit.edu/ 

These are in a nice format and regular enough (after some cleanup) to read in, parse into a json file, and manipulate.

The format is also nice enough to be worth mimicking for printing to a local html file for display.

Goal will be to create json structures containing all text from Shakespeare's dramatic works.
